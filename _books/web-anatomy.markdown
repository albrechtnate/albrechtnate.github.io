Design patterns (generic UI idioms, e.g. an accordion) and components (styled and coded instances of patterns) are familiar tools for rapidly building interfaces. Web Anatomy details a third tool, *interaction design frameworks,* which promote the reuse of proven UX patterns.

Frameworks are essentially *macro* design patterns: they describe collections of patterns, and typically focus on goal achievement (e.g. buying a book), as opposed to task completion (e.g. pagination controls to see more results). Most are generic enough to apply to many kinds of sites (e.g. the “catalog” framework is found on ecommerce and library sites; “sign-up” is found on social media and banking sites.)

The distinction between patterns and frameworks felt a bit forced. This book was OK, but I didn’t find it particularly eye-opening.
